\section*{Abstract}

%In this excercise we aim to model the rotation of stars within the Milky Way around its center. 
In this report we present a model for the rotation of stars in the Milky Way around its center.
%We introduce an inertial frame of reference centered at the center of the galaxy, with xy-plane coinciding with the galactic plane and x-axis pointing away from the Sun. We will denote it as CG frame.
In a simpler model, we are going to assume that the stars in the CG frame move in circular orbits around its origin with a constant velocity $V_{rot}$, as well as the LSR (Local Standard of Rest), and that the Sun frame is moving with a velocity $U_{\odot}$ in the x-direction and $V_{\odot}$ in the y-direction in the CG frame with respect to the LSR.

%We are going to assume that also LSR (Local Standard of Rest) is moving with a velocity $V_{rot}$ in the y-direction in the CG frame.
%We also introduce a frame of reference centered at the Sun, with the x-axis pointing towards the center of the galaxy, and the z-axis pointing towards the North Galactic Pole. We will denote it as Sun frame.
%The Sun frame is rotating with an angular velocity $w$ around the z-axis due to the rotation of the galaxy with respect to the CG frame.

%Our goal is to model the velocity of stars in the radial direction in the Sun frame of reference, and find $V_{rot}$, $U_0$ and $V_0$ using Baysian Inference on the data provided by the GAIA mission.

The data provided by GAIA DR2 [reference to gaia] contains, for each star, the parallax and the radial velocity with respect to the Sun, as well as its longitude with respect to the Sun frame of reference.
