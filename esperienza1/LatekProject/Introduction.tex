\section*{Abstract}
% In this report we present a model for the rotation of stars in the Milky Way around its center.
In this report, we present a Bayesian model for the rotational motion of stars in the Milky Way galaxy, 
using observational data from the Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2)~\cite{GAIADR2}. 
% Firstly, in a simpler model, we assume that the stars, as well as the Local Standard of Rest (LSR), 
% move in circular orbits around the origin of the Galactic Center (GC) frame with a constant velocity $V_{\text{rot}}$, 
% and that the Sun is moving with respect to the LSR with a velocity $U_{\odot}$ in the x-direction 
% and $V_{\odot}$ in the y-direction in the GC frame. 
We begin by introducing a simplified physical model in which both the stars and the Local Standard of Rest (LSR) 
follow circular orbits around the Galactic Center (GC) with a constant velocity $V_{\text{rot}}$. 
The Sun is modeled as moving relative to the LSR with components $U_{\odot}$ (in the $x$-direction) 
and $V_{\odot}$ (in the $y$-direction), all defined within the GC frame. 
% Then, we present a more complex model, in which for each star, a random component $v_{\text{rand}}' \sim N(0, \sigma)$ is added to its velocity.
We then extend this model by introducing a random velocity component $v_{\text{rand}}' \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma)$ for each star, 
to account for intrinsic stellar motion not captured by pure circular rotation.

% %In both cases we aim to model the velocity of stars in the radial direction in the Sun frame of reference. 
% Applying Bayesian inference on the data provided by GAIA Data Release 2 (DR2)~\cite{GAIADR2}, we find the distributions of parameters of the two models, namely $\mathbf{\theta_1} = (V_{\text{rot}}, U_{\odot}, V_{\odot})$ and $\mathbf{\theta_2} = (V_{\text{rot}}, U_{\odot}, V_{\odot}, \sigma)$.
% For each star on the galactic plane we consider its measured longitude, parallax, and radial velocity, with respect to the Sun frame of reference.
% We also consider the provided uncertainties of the measurements of parallax and radial velocity.

% We utilized the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) implementation from the emcee~\cite{EMCEE} package in Python to estimate the posterior distributions of both models.
Using Bayesian inference and applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling via the \texttt{emcee}~\cite{EMCEE} package, 
we estimate the posterior distributions of the model parameters. 
The inference is performed using stellar longitude, parallax, and radial velocity measurements, 
along with their associated uncertainties, all expressed in the Sun-centered reference frame.

% In the first one, we estimate the parameters and their 95\% confidence interval to be: % put this into a table in Data analysis:
For the simpler model, we estimate the parameters (with 95\% confidence intervals) as:  
$V_{\text{rot}} = 211.45 \pm 0.04$ \unit{\kilo\meter\per\second};  
$U_{\odot} = 11.638 \pm 0.005$ \unit{\kilo\meter\per\second};  
$V_{\odot} = 21.604 \pm 0.005$ \unit{\kilo\meter\per\second}.  

% With the second model instead, we got: 
In the extended model, which includes the velocity dispersion of all stars, we find: 
$V_{\text{rot}} = 204 \pm 2$ \unit{\kilo\meter\per\second};  
$U_{\odot} = 11.7 \pm 0.3$ \unit{\kilo\meter\per\second};  
$V_{\odot} = 21.7 \pm 0.3$ \unit{\kilo\meter\per\second};  
$\sigma = 30.6 \pm 0.2$ \unit{\kilo\meter\per\second}.
