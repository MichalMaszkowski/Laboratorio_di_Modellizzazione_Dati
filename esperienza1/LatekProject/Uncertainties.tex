\subsection{Uncertainties}

GAIA measurements are affected by statistical uncertainties on the evaluations of the parallax and the radial velocity. We assume the measurements to be random variables sampled from a gaussian distributrion centered at the true value of the respective quantity, with standard deviation given by the error reported by GAIA ($v_{rad} \sim N(\tilde{v}_{rad})$). Assuming the pysical model to be exact, and the measurements to be independant, the difference between the direct measure of the radial velocity, and the corresponding value given by the model by eq.\ref{eq:VSunRad} is a random variable with variance that can be computed through propagation of errors as described in the following.
