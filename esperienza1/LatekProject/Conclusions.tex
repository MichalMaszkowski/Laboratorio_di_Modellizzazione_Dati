\section{Conclusions}

The median values and 95\% confidence intervals of the posterior distributions for both models are reported in Table~\ref{tab:parameter_estimates}. The estimates for $U_\odot$ and $V_\odot$ are consistent across the two models, while the estimates for $V_{\text{rot}}$ differ significantly â€” their respective 95\% confidence intervals do not overlap.

The inferred values of $U_\odot$ from both models are in good agreement with results from the literature~\cite{LocalKinematics}, while the estimates of $V_\odot$ are notably higher and incompatible with those reported in the same source. Regarding $V_{\text{rot}}$, our values are lower than the literature estimate~\cite{GalacticKinematics}, but both models yield confidence intervals that partially overlap with the reference value, indicating general consistency.

The posterior distributions for all parameters are presented in Appendix~\ref{Appendix:PosteriorDistributions}. Additionally, the middle and lower panels of Figure~\ref{fig:DataModelPresentation} show the model predictions based on the median posterior values, using the longitude and parallax of the observed stars. For the second model, the effect of stellar random motion was simulated by adding a Gaussian noise term $v_{\text{rand}, i} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma)$, using the inferred value of $\sigma$.

Visually, it is evident that the second model provides a better fit to the data, highlighting the importance of incorporating the random motion of stars to accurately model their observed radial velocities.
